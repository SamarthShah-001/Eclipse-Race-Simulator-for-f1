### Features
* Zero Dependencies: Runs as a single index.html file. No npm install, no build process.

* Real-Time 2D Simulation: Uses React state and requestAnimationFrame for a smooth simulation loop.

* Dynamic Leaderboard: Automatically sorts cars by lap and total time, showing the leader's time and the gap for all other drivers.

* Live F1-Style HUD: Displays laps, a smoothed speedometer, and key stats in a clean, non-blocking layout.

* SVG-Based Monza Track: Uses a complex SVG path to define the "Monza-like" track.

* SVG Car Models: Renders F1-style car shapes that automatically rotate to follow the track's curves.
